IYS Fish Health data 2019

Files:
Fit_Chip_IYS_GoA_2019_V2.csv:
Relative delta-delta CT values of gene epression by gene (columns) and individual (row). Positive value is expression above species mean, negative below. Transform to fold expression: 2Ë†(relative delta-delta CT)
Pathogens_IYS_GoA_2019.csv
Relative-CT values of pathogen detection by pathogen (columns) and individual (row). Value correlates exponentially with copies of pathogens detected (~ 2^Relative-CT).
Sample_info_IYS_GoA_2019_Fish_Health.csv
Identification of sample to Floy-Tag number, species, and capture location.
Pathogen_info.csv
Pathogen abbreviation ID

Gene abbreviation ID and gene class

Background:
Salmon were dissected at sea and organ samples stored in RNAlater. 
Nucleic acids were extracted using TRI-reagent, 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, and MagMAX-96 beads for RNA, or TNES-urea and BioSprint 96 DNA extraction kit for DNA.
cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript VILO and STA-PCRs were perfromed using TaqMan.
qPCR for pathogen detection and host gene expressionona was perfromed on 96.96 dynamic Fluidigm arrays
